simple cs2 aimbot and esp, for linux only.

Releases are tagged `v<version>` matching the version in `Cargo.toml` (e.g. `v1.0.0`).
The built-in update checker compares against the latest release tag and will prompt when a newer version is available.

## Quick Start

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/avitran0/deadlocked/releases).
Each release contains the `deadlocked` binary and `setup.sh`.

**Setup (one-time only):**

```bash
./setup.sh
# Restart your machine (required)
```

This creates a `uinput` group, adds your user to it, and installs a udev rule.
You only need to do this once, even when updating to newer versions.

**Run:**

```bash
./deadlocked
```

The binary will refuse to start if setup hasn't been completed.
Also make sure the `uinput` kernel module is loaded.
Running NixOS or Fedora Atomic? See [OS-Specific Setup](os-setup.md).

## FAQ

### Where are my configs saved?

Configs are saved in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` with fallback to `$HOME/.config`. Otherwise they're saved alongside the executable.

### Which desktop environments and window managers are supported?

**Best support:**

- GNOME (Mutter)
- KDE (KWin)

**Good support:**

- SwayWM
- Weston

**Fair support:**

- i3
- OpenBox
- XFCE
- Hyprland (tweaks may be needed; no guarantees)

### I'm using Hyprland and something doesn't work

Hyprland has poor X11 support for the techniques this cheat uses, not much i can do about that.
Try another WM if possible.

### I'm using Gamescope and the overlay is too small

The game still thinks it's running in 16:9 resolution, so the cheat gets the wrong window resolution.
Try running the game without Gamescope.

### My screen/overlay is black

Your compositor or window manager doesn't support transparency, or it's not enabled.

On KDE, go into the `Display and Monitor` settings, then `Compositor`, and tick `Enable compositor on startup`.

### The overlay shows but I can't click anything

The window couldn't be made click-through. This is a window manager/compositor limitation.

### The overlay doesn't show up

Your window manager doesn't support positioning or resizing windows.

### The overlay isn't on top of other windows

Your window manager doesn't support always-on-top windows.
