Releases are tagged `v<version>` matching the version in `Cargo.toml` (e.g. `v1.0.0`).
The built-in update checker compares against the latest release tag and will prompt when a newer version is available.

## Quick Start

> [!NOTE]
> Running NixOS, Fedora Atomic, Hyprland (Legacy .conf config)?
> 
> See the [compatibility,md](compatibility.md).

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/avitran0/deadlocked/releases). Each release contains the `deadlocked` binary and `setup.sh`.

**Setup (one-time only):**

```bash
./setup.sh
```
> **Restart your machine (required)**

This creates a `uinput` group, adds your user to it, and installs a udev rule.
You only need to do this once, even when updating to newer versions.

**Run:**

```bash
./deadlocked
```

The binary will refuse to start if setup hasn't been completed.
Also make sure the `uinput` kernel module is loaded.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>I'm using Hyprland and something doesn't work</summary>

Hyprland has poor X11 support for the techniques this cheat uses, not much I can do about that.
Try another WM if possible.

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>I'm using Gamescope and the overlay is too small</summary>

The game still thinks it's running in 16:9 resolution, so the cheat gets the wrong window resolution.
Try running the game without Gamescope.

</details>

<details>
<summary>My screen/overlay is black</summary>

Your compositor or window manager doesn't support transparency, or it's not enabled.

On KDE, go into **Display and Monitor** settings, then **Compositor**, and tick **Enable compositor on startup**.

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>The overlay shows but I can't click anything</summary>

The window couldn't be made click-through. This is a window manager/compositor limitation.

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>The overlay doesn't show up</summary>

Your window manager doesn't support positioning or resizing windows.

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>The overlay isn't on top of other windows</summary>

Your window manager doesn't support always-on-top windows.
